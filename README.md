# Portfolio website

**[Check the website here](https://gouh0002.github.io/mtm6201_final/)**

This is a portfolio website I created to showcase webdevelopment and design skills learnt during my scholarship at [Algonquincollege Interactive media design program](https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/interactive-media-design/).

Creating this website was a rewarding process, starting fromscratch the design part using Figma going from a low fidelity wireframe anditerating with feedback from our professor and peers until the full functioningprototype.

In the design process I made use of my photoshop skills to createthe logo and the banner. As design tool, Figma offers a lot of possibilities,and I deep dove into itâ€™s feature as self taught to take the most advantage ofit.

The process of translating the design into web code is achallenge as to remain as faithful as possible to the Moke-up. And I am quitesatisfied with the result and the journey is rewarding.

To stylise the website, I used [Bootstrap 5.3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/) most of the time except for some minor CSS customizations.

## Libraries

In addition to BS5 I also used the following libraries:

- [Bootstrap-icons 1.11.3](https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/tag/v1.11.3): mainly for social media icons.

- [Animate.css4.1.1](https://github.com/animate-css/animate.css/releases/tag/v4.1.1): to create an animated effect for the photo gallery and the contact form.

- [Overlay1.0.5](https://github.com/m-thalmann/overlayjs/releases/tag/v1.0.5): a JS library to create the overlay effect for the contact form without creatinga dedicated html page.

The photographs used in this website and the visual elements are all taken by me.
